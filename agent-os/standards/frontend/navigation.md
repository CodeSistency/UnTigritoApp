## Android Navigation best practices

- **Type-Safe Navigation**: Use type-safe navigation with sealed classes for route definitions
- **Navigation Graph**: Organize navigation in clear, logical graphs with proper nesting
- **Deep Linking**: Support deep links for important screens and user flows
- **Back Stack Management**: Handle back navigation appropriately for different user flows
- **State Preservation**: Preserve UI state during configuration changes and process death
- **Navigation Arguments**: Pass data through navigation arguments rather than global state when possible
- **Conditional Navigation**: Handle authentication and onboarding flows with conditional navigation
- **Error Navigation**: Provide clear navigation paths for error states and recovery
- **Testing**: Test navigation flows with Navigation Testing library
