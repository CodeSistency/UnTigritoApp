## Mobile app security best practices

- **API Security**: Use HTTPS for all API communications with proper certificate validation
- **Authentication**: Implement secure JWT-based authentication with appropriate token expiration
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all input data on the server side
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS properly for mobile app domains
- **API Keys**: Secure API keys and secrets; never expose them in mobile app code
- **User Data Protection**: Implement proper data privacy controls and user consent mechanisms
- **Audit Logging**: Log security-relevant events for monitoring and compliance
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and security patches up to date
