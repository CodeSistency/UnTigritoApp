# Implementation Plan: Task Group 4 - Test Review & Integration Testing

**Assigned implementer:** testing-engineer
**Spec reference:** agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-client-module/spec.md
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1-3 (should be mostly complete)
**Status:** Pending Implementation

## Task Breakdown

### 4.0 Review existing tests and fill critical gaps
This parent task encompasses reviewing all tests from previous task groups and writing additional integration tests.

  - Verify RequestsScreen tab switching tests
  - Verify ClientProfileScreen data display tests
  - Verify PaymentScreen flow tests
  - Verify BottomNavigationBar navigation tests

**Total existing tests:** Approximately 22 tests

### 4.2 Analyze test coverage gaps for client module
**Identify critical missing coverage**

Focus ONLY on client module requirements:
- [ ] End-to-end user journeys not covered:
  - Complete flow: Login → Home → Browse Professionals → View Service Details → Create Request
  - Complete flow: Browse Services → Select Service → Negotiate Price → Submit Request
  - Complete flow: Manage Requests → Accept Offer → Finalize Request
  - Complete flow: Recharge Balance → Select Method → Confirm Payment
  
- [ ] Navigation edge cases:
  - Tab switching while API request in progress
  - Navigation with offline connection
  - Back navigation from nested screens
  
- [ ] Form submission workflows:
  - CreateRequestScreen with all fields
  - PaymentScreen method selection and confirmation
  - ClientProfileScreen role switching
  
- [ ] API integration scenarios:
  - Offline fallback to cached data
  - Retry logic on network failure
  - Token refresh during request
  - Authentication error handling
  
- [ ] Data persistence:
  - Data survives app restart
  - Cache invalidation when needed
  - Sync on app resume
  
- [ ] Performance:
  - Large list scrolling performance
  - Image loading optimization
  - Memory management with cached data

### 4.3 Write up to 10 additional strategic tests maximum
**Fill critical gaps with focused tests**

Write only the most critical missing tests (maximum 10):

- [ ] **Test 1: End-to-end Create Request Flow**
  - Start at Home → Navigate to Services → Select Service → Fill Form → Submit
  - Verify request appears in Requests screen
  - Verify UI state updates correctly

- [ ] **Test 2: End-to-end Payment Flow**
  - Navigate to Profile → Payment Screen → Select Recharge Method
  - Verify bank details display correctly
  - Verify "Ya pagué" confirmation works

- [ ] **Test 3: Tab Navigation Robustness**
  - Switch between tabs while API requests pending
  - Verify app doesn't crash
  - Verify requests complete in background

- [ ] **Test 4: Offline Cache Fallback**
  - Load screen online → Verify API data displayed
  - Go offline → Verify cached data still displays
  - Retry online → Verify new data fetches

- [ ] **Test 5: Request Status Workflow**
  - Create request → Move to "Abiertas" tab
  - Accept offer → Move to "En Curso" tab
  - Finalize → Move to "Historial" tab

- [ ] **Test 6: Form Validation**
  - Submit CreateRequestScreen with missing fields
  - Verify validation errors displayed
  - Fix errors and resubmit successfully

- [ ] **Test 7: Professional List Search**
  - Load professionals list → Search by name
  - Filter by specialty
  - Verify results update correctly

- [ ] **Test 8: Service Detail Negotiation**
  - Load service detail → Toggle negotiation mode
  - Enter min/max prices → Submit offer
  - Verify offer created successfully

- [ ] **Test 9: Profile Update**
  - Update profile information → Save changes
  - Verify changes reflected in UI
  - Verify data persisted

- [ ] **Test 10: Error Recovery**
  - Trigger API error (network timeout)
  - Verify error message displayed
  - Retry request → Verify recovery

### 4.4 Run feature-specific tests only
**Execute and verify test suite**

- [ ] Run ONLY tests related to client module:
  - Task 1.1 tests (6 tests)
  - Task 2.1 tests (8 tests)
  - Task 3.1 tests (8 tests)
  - Task 4.3 tests (up to 10 tests)
  - **Total: approximately 32 tests maximum**

- [ ] Do NOT run the entire application test suite
- [ ] Verify all client module tests pass successfully
- [ ] Document any failures and root causes
- [ ] Verify critical client workflows pass
- [ ] Check test coverage for this feature only

## Test Organization

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests (≈6 tests from Task 1.1):**
- User model with client fields
- ServicePosting model
- Professional model
- Request model
- Transaction model
- Repository cache behavior

**API Integration Tests (≈8 tests from Task 2.1):**
- Authentication endpoints
- User profile endpoints
- Professional listings
- Service posting operations
- Request/offer management
- Payment information
- Error handling
- Token refresh

**UI Component Tests (≈8 tests from Task 3.1):**
- HomeScreen rendering
- ServicesScreen search/filter
- CreateRequestScreen validation
- ServiceDetailScreen interactions
- RequestsScreen tabs

- PaymentScreen flow
- Navigation

**Integration Tests (≈10 tests from Task 4.3):**
- End-to-end user workflows
- Navigation flows
- Offline/online transitions
- Form submissions
- Data persistence
- Error recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ All feature-specific tests pass (approximately 32 total)
- ✅ No more than 10 additional tests added by testing-engineer
- ✅ Critical client module workflows covered
- ✅ End-to-end flows verified
- ✅ Error scenarios handled
- ✅ Task Group 4 sub-tasks marked complete in tasks.md

## Testing Best Practices
- Use JUnit 5 for unit tests
- Use MockK for mocking dependencies
- Use Turbine for Flow testing
- Use Espresso/Compose testing for UI tests
- Keep tests focused and single-responsibility
- Use descriptive test names
- Document test purpose and expected outcomes
- Ensure tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)

## Documentation
- Document any test failures found
- Record test execution results
- List coverage gaps that couldn't be addressed
- Provide recommendations for future testing phases

## Notes
- Focus on critical paths only - don't attempt exhaustive coverage
- Testing-engineer should NOT implement features, only write tests
- If tests reveal bugs, document them but don't fix in implementation
- Testing phase can run in parallel with UI implementation if needed

## Next Steps
After Task Group 4 completion, proceed to Phase 3 (Verification) where android-verifier will validate all implementations.
