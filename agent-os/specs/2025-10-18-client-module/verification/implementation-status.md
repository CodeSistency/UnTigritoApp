## Architecture Overview

### Data Layer
```
Models (5 entities)
  ↓
Room Database
  ↓
DAOs (Data Access Objects)
  ↓
Repositories (with cache)
```

### API Layer
```
API Services (7 services)
  ↓
ClientRepository (unified interface)
  ↓
Error Handling & Retry Logic
  ↓
Token Management
```

### UI Layer
```
Screens (7 screens)
  ↓

## Implementation Timeline

**Recommended Execution Order:**
1. **Task Group 1** (Data Layer) - Foundation for all other layers
2. **Task Group 2** (API Integration) - Depends on Task Group 1, required by UI
3. **Task Group 3** (Mobile UI) - Depends on Task Groups 1 & 2
4. **Task Group 4** (Testing) - Can run parallel to UI, but after groups 1-2

**Estimated Duration:**
- Task Group 1: 2-3 days
- Task Group 2: 2-3 days
- Task Group 3: 3-4 days
- Task Group 4: 1-2 days
- **Total: 8-12 days estimated**

## Verification Strategy

### Pre-Verification
- Check that all required files exist
- Verify structure and formatting

### Group-Specific Verification
- Run focused tests for each group
- Verify acceptance criteria met
- Check implementation guides followed

### Integration Verification
- Run all ~32 tests together
- Verify cross-layer data flow
- Test offline/online scenarios
- Verify navigation flows

### Documentation Verification
- Verify all tasks marked complete
- Generate verification report
- Document any issues

---

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- ✅ Clean Architecture + MVVM pattern
- ✅ Kotlin best practices
- ✅ Hilt dependency injection
- ✅ Coroutines + Flow for async
- ✅ Material Design 3 compliance

### Testing Standards
- ✅ Unit tests for models and repositories
- ✅ Integration tests for API layer
- ✅ UI tests for Compose components
- ✅ End-to-end workflow tests
- ✅ Focused testing approach (2-8 tests per group, ~32 total)

### Documentation Standards
- ✅ Clear task breakdown
- ✅ Specific acceptance criteria
- ✅ Implementation guides provided
- ✅ Verification checklists included

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| API contract mismatch | Reference back.md API documentation |
| Database schema issues | Use existing Room patterns from project |
| UI state management complexity | Use established ViewModel + StateFlow pattern |
| Test flakiness | Focus on focused, deterministic tests only |
| Scope creep | Clear task boundaries and acceptance criteria |

---

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All ~32 tests pass
- ✅ All 4 task groups complete
- ✅ All screens render and navigate correctly
- ✅ Data flows through all layers
- ✅ API integration functional
- ✅ Material Design 3 compliance
- ✅ Material Design 3 compliance
- ✅ Offline functionality working

## Next Steps

### For Implementers
1. Review assigned task group implementation guide
2. Review spec.md for requirements context
3. Implement each subtask according to guide
4. Run focused tests (don't run full suite)
5. Mark subtasks complete in tasks.md
6. Document any issues in implementation report

### For Verifiers
1. Review implementation-verification-guide.md
2. Run focused tests for each task group
3. Verify acceptance criteria met
4. Create verification report
5. Request fixes if issues found

### For Project Manager
1. Assign task groups to implementers
2. Monitor progress against timeline
3. Support resolution of blockers
4. Track completion and quality metrics
