# Verification Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the verification strategy for the UnTigritoApp Project Setup implementation. Verification is delegated to specialized verifier subagents based on the implementers' verified_by assignments.

- [ ] Component signatures are clear
- [ ] Preview functions exist for UI review
- [ ] Components follow Compose best practices

**Verification Steps**:
1. Review component structure

## Verification Workflow

### For Android Verifier:

1. **Collect Implementation Reports**
   - Read all implementation reports from `implementation/` directory
   - Review tasks.md for completed task checkmarks
   - Note any implementation notes or challenges

2. **Verify Each Group**
   - Follow verification steps for each group
   - Check acceptance criteria
   - Run necessary tests and builds
   - Document findings

3. **Create Verification Report**
   - Document verification results
   - Note any issues found
   - Provide specific examples
   - Include recommendations

4. **Place Verification Report**
   - Create `[group-number]_[group-name]_verification.md` files
   - Place in `agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-new-feature/verification/`

## Verification Schedule

**Phase 3**: Verification of Implementations
- Android verifier verifies all implemented groups
- Verification reports placed in verification/ directory
- Issues documented and categorized

**Phase 4**: Final Verification
- Implementation-verifier performs final comprehensive check
- Final verification report created
- Go/no-go decision documented

---

## Escalation Path

If verification finds issues:
1. Document issue with specific details
2. Notify implementer with clear feedback
3. Provide suggestions for resolution
4. Re-verify after fixes
