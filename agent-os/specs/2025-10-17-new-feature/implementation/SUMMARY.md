## Next Steps in Workflow

### 1. Implementation Phase (In Progress)

**Android Developer** should:
1. Read `spec.md` for complete technical requirements
2. Review `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for workflow
3. Implement Groups 1-5 and 7 following acceptance criteria
4. Check off tasks in `tasks.md` as completed
5. Create implementation reports for each group

**Testing Engineer** should:
1. Read `spec.md` for complete technical requirements
2. Review `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for workflow
3. Implement Group 6 following acceptance criteria
4. Check off tasks in `tasks.md` as completed
5. Create implementation report for Group 6

### 2. Verification Phase (After Implementation)

**Android Verifier** should:
1. Read all implementation reports
2. Review completed tasks in `tasks.md`
3. Follow verification checklist in `VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`
4. Create group-specific verification reports
5. Document any issues found
6. Provide recommendations

### 3. Final Verification Phase (After Group Verifications)

**Implementation Verifier** should:
1. Review all group verification reports
2. Compile final verification report
3. Verify all acceptance criteria met
4. Make go/no-go decision
5. Update `final-verification.md` with results
